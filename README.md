# push_swap

The "push_swap" project at 42 is a challenging task integrated into the programming school's curriculum. The main objective is to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations on two stacks, referred to as "a" and "b". The allowed operations include push, pop, rotate, and reverse rotate.

Participants are required to create a C program that takes an unsorted list of numbers as an argument and, using the allowed operations, efficiently sorts these numbers in ascending order on stack "a". The challenge lies in finding an optimized solution that minimizes the total number of operations performed.

The project assesses not only the students' ability to implement efficient sorting algorithms but also their optimization skills and understanding of basic data structures and stack manipulation. It serves as an opportunity for students to enhance their problem-solving and C programming skills.
